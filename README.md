### Martin-LÃ¶f Type Theory

- Chapter 1 in the [HoTT Book](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/) gives a concise introduction to MLTT.

### Homotopy Theory

- For a refresher or quick introduction to point-set topology, I highly recommend Klaus Janich's Springer UTM series textbook _Topology_. Feel free to skip the parts about homology. But make sure to pay special attention to CW-complexes.
- Any textbook on Algebraic Topology, really.

### Homotopy Type Theory

- Of course, the [HoTT Book](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/). Although the authors cautioned that the book shouldn't be seen as a golden reference, going through all of it will give a solid foundation on the type theory aspect of HoTT.
